This mobile application aims to address traffic-related issues faced by both the public and the government by leveraging advanced AI technologies. This project, part of my final year academic endeavor, seeks to enhance traffic management and safety through real-time detection and reporting of traffic violations. The app integrates seamlessly with an AI-powered system that detects infractions such as speeding, running red lights, illegal parking, and reckless driving.
